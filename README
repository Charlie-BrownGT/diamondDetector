Things to do: 

Simplify the detector selection process by introducing if statements in the detector function. 
Automate the name generation process by using variables in the detector construction, then reading them together into the file name within run.cc.
Re-order the variable order to make changing the detector setup easy. 
Investigate which detector construction variables can be changed with a user defined message (suspect beam, construction may be more difficult).
Potentially write the file names into a folder for ingestion into the analysis macro. 

Not before producing counts as a function of either angle or spatial distribution.
