Things to do: 

Automate the name generation process by using variables in the detector construction, then reading them together into the file name within run.cc.
Investigate which detector construction variables can be changed with a user defined message (suspect beam, construction may be more difficult) - tested and works, this is all done within the construction files and via macros, check this to invesigate for ID and DD changes.

Diamond detector set to be at least 40cm from ion source, likely between 50 and 80cm. Angular acceptance of the ion chamber is 3 degrees.
