These results have been produced with 10^5 particles per run. The runs were generated by varying the beam angle between 2 and 4 degrees in increments of 0.5. The results with a suffix 1 correspond to 2 degrees, 2, 2.5 degrees, and so on. Some runs did not produce any observations, e.g. small beam angles on the SD, so these results are not present.
