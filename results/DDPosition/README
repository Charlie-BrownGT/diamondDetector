These results were collected by varying the diamond detector position. All other variables remained the same, that is:

Results compiled compare the number of particles incident on the SD, the ID and DD combined, then each ID and DD individually. 

An unquantified observation - more photon emmissions occur when the diamond detector is closer to the particle source, suspect this is likely due to larger number of incident ions.
